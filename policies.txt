L6: Unprotected Work at Height ≤6 ft or Above Lower Levels

Description: Work on platforms, mezzanines, roofs, or open-sided floors at or slightly above lower levels without adequate fall protection (guardrails, covers, or personal fall arrest) where a fall can cause serious injury but is not yet clearly in the highest-risk category (e.g., short unprotected edges, low mezzanine with cluttered lower level).

L6: Improper Ladder Use with Significant Fall Risk

Description: Use of ladders on unstable surfaces, near edges, or in ways that could lead to falls from heights where serious injuries are likely, such as leaning extension ladders on non-secured points, using metal ladders near energized equipment, or climbing with hands full.

L6: Machine Guarding Deficiencies (Point-of-Operation Accessible)

Description: Missing, disabled, or improperly adjusted machine guards that allow hands or other body parts to reach points of operation, ingoing nip points, or rotating parts during normal use, but where the machine can still be locked out or taken out of service before use, e.g., “Press running with interlock taped over.”

L6: Incomplete Lockout/Tagout During Servicing

Description: Servicing, maintenance, or clearing jams where some but not all energy sources are controlled, written procedures are missing or incomplete, or lockout/tagout devices are inconsistently applied, creating a strong possibility of unexpected startup or release of stored energy, e.g., “Clearing jam on conveyor with only e-stop pressed.”

L6: Powered Industrial Truck (PIT) Unsafe Operation

Description: Operation of forklifts or other powered industrial trucks by untrained or uncertified operators, or unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive speed, riding on forks, failing to sound horn at intersections, or transporting unsecured loads in occupied areas, where collision or tip-over is likely, e.g., “Forklift driving fast through blind corner in busy aisle.” 

L6: Unsafe Storage, Racking, and Overloading

Description: Racking systems, shelving, or storage areas that are obviously overloaded, visibly damaged, or improperly loaded (heavy items high, mixed pallets, missing beam pins) where collapse is credible but not yet occurring, e.g., “Bent rack upright supporting multiple full pallets of product.”

L6: Significant Chemical Handling Violations

Description: Handling hazardous chemicals (corrosives, solvents, toxic dusts) without appropriate PPE, ventilation, or containment where workers may be exposed to skin contact or inhalation at harmful levels, but no active spill or acute release is underway, e.g., “Mixing solvent in small unventilated room without respirator.”

L6: Serious Electrical Exposure (Non-Qualified Work)

Description: Access to energized parts by unqualified workers, use of non-rated tools or equipment around exposed conductors, or work in areas with open electrical cabinets without barriers, where shock or arc-flash is credible, e.g., “Panel cover removed with live components exposed in occupied hallway.”

L6: Inadequate Emergency Preparedness and Lack of Procedures

Description: Failure to establish or practice emergency procedures (fire, hazardous material release, severe weather, workplace violence) where employees do not know how to respond, creating significant risk if an emergency occurs, e.g., “No one knows evacuation routes or alarm tones in a multi-story facility.”

L6: Repeated PPE Non-Use in High-Risk Areas

Description: Pattern of employees failing to use required respiratory, eye/face, or hearing protection in areas with known high exposures, even after prior warnings or training, e.g., “Workers repeatedly welding without face shield where eye injury risk is high.”

L7: Unprotected Work at Height >6 ft (Fall Protection – General Requirements)

Description: Employees working on roofs, leading edges, scaffolds, mezzanines, or other elevated walking-working surfaces more than 6 feet above lower levels without required fall protection systems (guardrails, safety nets, or personal fall arrest), e.g., “Crew working on roof edge 20 ft up with no harnesses or guardrails.”

L7: Severe Ladder or Scaffold Violations with Imminent Fall Hazard

Description: Use of ladders or scaffolds that are structurally unsound, improperly erected (missing guardrails or midrails, incomplete planking, unsecured base), or used in ways that create immediate risk of serious or fatal falls, e.g., “Worker on top of mobile scaffold with missing guardrails and unlocked wheels.”

L7: Zero Lockout/Tagout During Hazardous Servicing
